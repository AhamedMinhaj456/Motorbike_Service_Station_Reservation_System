A motorbike, also known as a motorcycle, consists of several main parts, each serving a specific function. Here are some of the key components:

Frame:
The frame is the main structural component of the motorcycle, providing support and housing for all
 other parts.

Engine:
The engine is the heart of the motorcycle, responsible for generating power by burning fuel and
converting it into mechanical energy. It typically includes components such as cylinders, pistons,
crankshaft, and valves.

Fuel System:
The fuel system delivers fuel from the tank to the engine. It includes components such as the fuel tank,
fuel pump, carburetor or fuel injector, and fuel lines.

Transmission:
The transmission transfers power from the engine to the wheels, allowing the rider to control speed
and torque. It usually consists of a gearbox with gears and a clutch mechanism.

Wheels and Tires:
Motorcycles have two wheels, each equipped with a tire. The wheels are connected to
the frame via the suspension system and rotate to propel the motorcycle forward.

Suspension System:
The suspension system absorbs shocks and vibrations from the road, providing a
smoother ride and enhancing stability. It includes components such as forks (front suspension)
and shock absorbers (rear suspension).

Braking System:
The braking system allows the rider to slow down or stop the motorcycle. It typically consists
of disc brakes or drum brakes mounted on the wheels, brake calipers, brake pads, and brake lines.

Handlebars:
The handlebars are used by the rider to steer the motorcycle. They are connected to the front
fork and may include controls for the throttle, brakes, and other functions.

Seat:
The seat provides a comfortable and ergonomic position for the rider and passenger. It is mounted
on the frame and may be adjustable or removable.

Electrical System:
The electrical system includes components such as the battery, alternator, wiring harness, lights
(headlights, taillights, turn signals), ignition system, and instrumentation
(speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge).

Exhaust System:
The exhaust system expels exhaust gases from the engine and muffles engine noise. It includes components
such as the exhaust pipes, catalytic converter (in some models), and muffler.

Fairings and Bodywork:
Fairings and bodywork are outer panels that cover and protect the motorcycle's components. They also
contribute to aerodynamics and aesthetics.
